    <h3>Presentation Authentication</h3>
    <p>
      The following sequence of events is necessary for a holder to present data to a verifier:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The verifier MUST establish the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html">OAuth 2.0</a> binding by
        providing client ID and secret to the holder.
      </li>
      <li>
      At time of presentation, the holder MUST authenticate by obtaining an
        <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-interop/openapi/#auth">access token</a> through the client
        credentials flow. Subsequent <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-interop/openapi/#post-/presentations">
        presentations</a> are made with the access token in the request header.
      </li>
    </ul>
