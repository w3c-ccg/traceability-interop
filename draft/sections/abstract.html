  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This specification describes discovery and exchange mechanisms of [[[VC-DATA-MODEL]]] [[VC-DATA-MODEL]],
    particularly as they relate to supply chain use cases.
    Exchanged Verifiable Credentials often implement schemas defined in
    the [[[TRACE-VOCAB]]] [[TRACE-VOCAB]]..
  </p>
  <p>
    Using Verifiable Credentials to represent supply chain data enables interoperability between disparate actors,
    and provides the ability to cryptographically verify the authenticity of the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification uses [[[DID-CORE]]] [[DID-CORE]]
    to identify organizations within a supply chain. This enables organizations to interact with parties
    outside their traditional supply chains, and removes the need for a central authority to identify supply chain
    organizations.
