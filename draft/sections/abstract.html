  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This specification describes discovery and exchange mechanisms of [Verifiable
    Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/), particularly as they relate to supply chain use cases.
    Exchanged Verifiable Credentials often implement schemas defined in the [Traceability Vocab
    Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/).
  </p>
  <p>
    Using Verifiable Credentials to represent supply chain data enables interoperability between disparate actors,
    and provides the ability to cryptographically verify the authenticity of the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification uses the [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
    specification to identify organizations within a supply chain. This enables organizations to interact with parties
    outside their traditional supply chains, and removes the need for a central authority to identify supply chain
    organizations.
