      This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
      Calendar Year target for major releases.
      Versioning tags will follow a pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
    </p>
    Version Definitions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
        version. Major versions MAY include
        breaking or non-backwards compatible changes
      </li>
      <li>MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
        functionality or extensions of objects</li>
      <li>PATCH - minor changes that are backwards compatible and resolve
        discovered issues or bugs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to
      integrate with and provide automated testing and validation against
      defined types without worry of instability
      or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the frequency of
      possibly breaking changes to prevent
      a large number of incompatible versions.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
      over an authenticated channel.
      Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP endpoints is defined, allowing
      authenticated data senders and receivers to
      exchange Verifiable Presentations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an interaction,
      notifying the receiver. The
      presentation receiver responds to the presentation intention with
      cryptographic material for completing the
      presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the Verifiable
      Presentation, which finally passed to the
      receiver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
      operation and provides example inputs and
      expected responses.

      <p>The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the
        larger family of W3C CCG standards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
          data in support of exchanged goods and
          services.
        </li>
        <li>The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
          verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.</li>
        <li>
          The <em>Process</em> layer defines standardized APIs for exchanging
          Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and
          Verifiable Presentations (trace-interop).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Linked Data</em> establishes a concise semantic context of the

        <li>
          <em>Semantics</em> are defined in a multitude of established
          vocabularies and come in many forms, from

    <h2>Workflows</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Workflows</em> are a critical concept in this specification that enable presenters to correlate individual presentations. A <em>Workflow Definition</em> can be used to indicate that a presentation intends to meet a defined set of data requirements; a <em>Workflow Instance</em> indicates that a presentation should be considered in conjunction with other presentations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The data model for indicating Workflow identifiers on Traceable Presentations is defined in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-interop/draft/#presentations">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-interop/draft/#presentations</a>. 
    </p>
    <h3>Workflow Definitions</h3>
    <p>
      A Workflow Definition <em>MUST</em> be defined by a URN which resolves to a workflow definition manifest file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workflow definition manifest YAML file defines:
      <ul>
        <li>`id` — identifier to be referenced.</li>
        <li>`title` — a title of the workflow definition</li>
        <li>`description` — indicates applicable circumstances and expected procedures for the workflow</li>
        <li>`tags` — listing applicable industry verticals</li>
        <li>`credentials` — listing verifiable credentials types which are required to attain the goals of the workflow</li>
        <li>`mermaid` — diagram which contextualizes the involved workflow parties and their roles</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <h4>Referencing Workflow Definition</h4>
    <p>
      By referencing a Workflow Definition `id` in a Traceable Presentation, the holder indicates to the verifier the intention of making the presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#us-cbp-entry">https://w3id.org/traceability/#us-cbp-entry</a> indicates that an Importer intends to import goods following common US CBP Entry filings.
    </p>
    <p>      
      Multiple Workflow Definitions <em>MAY</em> be referenced by a Traceable Presentation, indicating that multiple relevant circumstances apply. 
    </p>
    <p>      
      For example, when <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#us-cbp-entry">https://w3id.org/traceability/#us-cbp-entry</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#importer-security-filing">https://w3id.org/traceability/#importer-security-filing</a> are together, they indicate that goods are arriving by vessel, so the entry is subject to Importer Security Filings in addition to the Common CBP Entry Filings. 
    </p>
    <h3>Workflow Instances</h3>    
    <p>
      A Workflow Instance <em>MUST</em> be defined by a URN for a UUID v4. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By referencing the same Workflow Instance `id` in separate Traceable Presentations, the holder indicates to the verifier that the presentations are related. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, an initial presentation of an Intent to Import Credential may be followed at a later date by presentation of a Commercial Invoice Credential. The two presentations reference a common Workflow Instance identifier to indicate that they relate to the same shipment import.
    </p>
    <h4>Multiple Holders Referencing a Workflow Instance</h4>
    <p>
      Multiple holders <em>MAY</em> reference the same Workflow Instance `id` in their Traceable Presentations. In the context of customs procedures, a Workflow Instance can be thought of as the traditional "pouch" of documents filed for clearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, after having verified import-related credential, the customs authority references the same Workflow Instance `id` when presenting a customs release credential back to the importer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another common example is when separate issuers are filing credentials related to the same import, such as an Importer of Record and a Freight Forwarder making presentations related to the same shipment import. 
    </p>
    <h4>Referencing Multiple Instances</h4>
    <p>
      The same Traceable Presentation <em>MAY</em> reference multiple Workflow Instances. This is an indication by the holder that the verifier should consider the two Workflow Instances as one. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, an Importer of Record and a Freight Forwarder may have initially made presentations to Customs related to the same shipment; when either of them becomes aware of the other Workflow Instance `id`, including both `id`s in the same Traceable Presentation indicates to Customs that the two instances are part of the same shipment import. 
    </p>
    <h4>Relation to Workflow Definitions</h4>
    <p>
      A Workflow Instance <em>CAN</em> be related to one or more Workflow Definitions. This is done by referencing a Workflow Instance `id` and one or more Workflow Definition `id`s from the same Traceable Presentation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This way, the Workflow Instance's progress can be tracked by comparing the credentials which have been presented within the Workflow Instance (numerator) against the combined set of credentials types required by the targeted Workflow Definitions (denominator). 
    </p>

    <h2>Rules for Processing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data exchanged according to this specification will often need to
      be handled by external systems that have a more transactional
      nature. By design, data exchanged using this specification is
      asynchronous in nature. This means that certain rules should be
      followed to ensure that a reciever of data using this
      specification can assemble a graph of connected data elements and
      have a high degree of certainty (unless they are missing data)
      that the data they are looking at is the most current information,
      assembled in the right order, and is the best known state at a
      given time. The following section details rules for handling
      identifiers and references to data to prevent issues with
      informational processing.
    </p>
    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        Identifiers in objects exchanged using this specification are
        particularly important, not least in that they uniquely identify
        an object or network transaction, but also, given the
        asynchronous nature of this mode of data exchange, that they
        present an area where various attacks could arise by sending
        data with identifiers already in use with malicious intent to
        confuse a receiver of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifiers conformant with this spec <em>MUST</em> be
        [[rfc3986]] conformant URIs. Unless otherwise noted, an
        identifier <em>MAY</em> be a DID identifier per [[did-core]], a
        UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]], or a [[URL]] that identifies a resource
        directly.
      </p>
      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
          Presentations in this spec are
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>, which contain several notable identifiers
          that can be used for correlation, retrieval, and business rule
          processing of data.
        </p>
        These identifiers are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.id` — The unique ID of the
            presentation itself; think of this as identifying the wire
            transaction. This ID MUST be a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition` — The ID for the
            workflow definition, or the <em>type</em> of workflow that
            the presented credentials belong to. This ID MUST be a URN for a UUID
            v4 per [[rfc4122]], e.g., `urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6`.
          </li>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.workflow.instance` — The ID for the
            unique instance of the workflow, e.g., party A sending goods
            of a certain type (with particular data requirements to meet
            regulatory needs) to party B using workflow type X as
            defined by `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition`. This
            ID MUST be a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          `TraceablePresentation.id` <em>MUST</em> be unique to each
          presentation. A presentation received with a duplicate ID
          <em>MUST</em> be rejected with a 409 Conflict status code per
          [[rfc9110]]. A presenter encountering this error,
          <em>SHOULD</em> generate a new presentation, with a new UUID
          v4 for the ID and then retry the presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="502">
          The handling of duplicated `TraceablePresentation.id` requires discussion
          and consensus.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="485">
          There is active discussion regarding the addition of a member to a
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentation</a>
          with the name `replacesPresentation`. If this member is
          present, its value <em>SHOULD</em> be an ID of a prior
          presentation and <em>SHOULD</em> act as a signal to replace
          the prior presentation and any credentials contained within,
          and to prefer credentials in the new presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assemble a collection of Credentials linked together by a
          workflow, data may be queried by a combination of
          `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition` and
          `TraceablePresentation.workflow.instance`, assuming that the
          implementation's underlying data store persists presentation
          metadata upon receipt. Rules for ensuring the retrieval of the
          most "correct" credentials associated for that workflow
          instance are covered below in the section on Credentials.

          A `TraceablePresentation`, while being part of a two party
          exchange of information via a `VerifiablePresentation`,
          provides the ability for multiple parties to exchange related
          information by use of the same workflow definition and
          instance. Use of the same workflow definition and instance by
          multiple presenters implies that the credentials contained in
          the separate presentations are related, and
          <em>SHOULD</em> be treated as part of the same <em>instance</em> of a
          given workflow <em>type</em>. A good
          example of this type of scenario is when a vendor is exchanging some
          information, say a commercial invoice,
          with a third party, such as a broker, and the shipping company is
          presenting related information to that
          same broker.

          `verifiableCredential.id`. This ID is unique to the object,
          entity, or action described in the credential. As per the
          [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] "The id property is intended to
          unambiguously refer to an object, such as a person, product,

    <h2>Interoperability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Participating platforms are proving actual interoperability by
      enrolling in continuous integration tests. These tests are based
      on Postman collections which orchestrate the interaction of
      participating parties, such as `Credential Issuance`, `Credential
      Verification`, and `Presentation Exchange`. These Postman
      collections are described with a set of
      <a
        href="https://w3id.org/traceability/interoperability/tree/main/docs/tutorials">tutorials</a>
      that show how to run the tests against a particular implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interoperability report is continuously created from the
      results of executing these collections, targeting the
      participating platforms. In cases of multi-party interactions
      (such as party A making a verifiable presentation to party B), all
      combinations of platform interchange are executed. The
      Interoperability report is executed by a GitHub Action on the
      Traceability Interoperability GitHub repository:
      <a
        href="https://w3id.org/traceability/interoperability/actions/workflows/interoperability-report.yml">interoperability-report.yml</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In each test, the GitHub Action runner carries out a number of
      invocations, acting on behalf of varying parties taking different
      roles (`issuer`, `holder`, and `verifier`), in turn invoking the
      participating platform.
    </p>
    Below is an example of calls made by the runner as it is executing a
    DIDAuth Presentation Exchange flow:
    <ul>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/issue` on Party A's platform, representing
        Party A acting as `issuer`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/available` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/prove` on Party A's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>
        Runner calls `/presentations/submissions` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.
      </li>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/verify` on Party B's platform, representing
        Party B acting as `verifier`.</li>

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described in this
      specification. As with any web standard or protocol
      implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes this
      information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is
      important to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such
      as [[WCAG21]], to ensure that all people, regardless of ability,

      There are a number of internationalization considerations
      implementers should be aware of when publishing data described in

      implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it difficult

    <p>
      The W3C Group Note on

        Principles </a>
      serves well as general guidance for contributions
      to this specification, as well as for developers implementing a
      solution that is in compliance with or that interacts with
      solutions implementing this specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, when implementing any solution on the web, the
      developer should have a strong concern that their solution is
      implemented in an ethical manner that showcases the appropriate
      and ethical use of technology. Any such solution should provide a
      net positive social benefit, and be cognizant of the variety of
      principles that must be balanced when building and deploying a
      solution. The W3C TAG document on
      <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web
        Principles</a>
