      This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
      Calendar Year target for major releases.
      Versioning tags will follow a pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
    </p>
    Version Definitions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
        version. Major versions MAY include
        breaking or non-backwards compatible changes
      </li>
      <li>MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
        functionality or extensions of objects</li>
      <li>PATCH - minor changes that are backwards compatible and resolve
        discovered issues or bugs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to
      integrate with and provide automated testing and validation against
      defined types without worry of instability
      or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the frequency of
      possibly breaking changes to prevent
      a large number of incompatible versions.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
      over an authenticated channel.
      Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP endpoints is defined, allowing
      authenticated data senders and receivers to
      exchange Verifiable Presentations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an interaction,
      notifying the receiver. The
      presentation receiver responds to the presentation intention with
      cryptographic material for completing the
      presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the Verifiable
      Presentation, which finally passed to the
      receiver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
      operation and provides example inputs and
      expected responses.

      <p>The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the

      <ul>
        <li>
          At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
          data in support of exchanged goods and
          services.
        </li>
        <li>The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
          verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.</li>
        <li>
          The <em>Process</em> layer defines standardized APIs for exchanging
          Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and
          Verifiable Presentations (trace-interop).

    <h3>Workflows</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Workflows</em> are a critical concept in this specification that
      enable presenters to correlate individual
      presentations. A workflow <em>definition</em> can be used to indicate that
      presentations relate to the same
      <em>type</em>
      of workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workflow <em>instances</em> indicate that separate individual
      presentations are part of the same
      <em>instance</em> of a specified workflow <em>type</em>.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Workflows for US Customs and Border Protection (US CBP)</h3>
      <img src="resources/workflow-def-ex.png" alt="workflow-def-ex"
        width="75%" />
      <p>
        In the above example, two separate 7501 Entry Summaries are
        presented to US CBP at different points in time, and related to
        different imports. By specifying the same workflow
        <em>definition</em>, it is made clear to US CBP that both presentations
        relate to the same <em>type</em> of
        import workflow.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/workflow-inst-ex.png" alt="workflow-inst-ex"
        width="75%" />
      <p>
        The majority of data elements in a "10+2" Importer Security
        Filing must be presented to CBP no later than 24 hours before
        vessel loading, and the remaining data elements no later than 24
        hours before arrival. Specifying the same workflow
        <em>instance</em> indicates to US CBP that the two presentations are
        part of the same import workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        A workflow definition indended for use with US CBP imports
        <em>MUST</em>
        have a corresponding plain text
        <em>workflow manifest document</em> that may be uniquely
        identified, referenced, and retrieved by a third party in a
        publicly accessible and documented manner by the UUID of the
        workflow definition.
      </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="495">
        The content, formatting, and inclusion of a "workflow manifest document"
        does not yet have consensus, and needs to be formally defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        This workflow manifest document <em>MUST</em> list each required
        credential from the
        <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#terminology">
          Traceability Vocabulary</a>, one per line, identified by
        the "type" of credential, for the workflow to be considered
        "complete". Completeness in this sense refers to an optimal
        state, where all possible information that can be provided in
        relation to that workflow definition is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the credential "type", a space followed by a numeric value
        that ranges from `0` to `1`,
        <em>MAY</em> be added. If this value is not provided a value of 1
        <em>MUST</em> by inferred by any system using this property.
        This numeric value <em>MUST</em> be referred to as "weight", and
        <em>MAY</em> be utilized to calculate a weighted average
        indicating the completeness of a particular workflow instance.
      </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="494">
        The standard calculation for weighted averages and algorithm for
        calculating this weighted average indicating the completeness of
        available information <em>SHOULD</em> be described, along with
        examples.
      </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="490">
        Stakeholders at US CBP should be consulted to determine if this weighted

    <h2>Rules for Processing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data exchanged according to this specification will often need to
      be handled by external systems that have a more transactional
      nature. By design, data exchanged using this specification is
      asynchronous in nature. This means that certain rules should be
      followed to ensure that a reciever of data using this
      specification can assemble a graph of connected data elements and
      have a high degree of certainty (unless they are missing data)
      that the data they are looking at is the most current information,
      assembled in the right order, and is the best known state at a
      given time. The following section details rules for handling
      identifiers and references to data to prevent issues with
      informational processing.
    </p>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        Identifiers in objects exchanged using this specification are
        particularly important, not least in that they uniquely identify
        an object or network transaction, but also, given the
        asynchronous nature of this mode of data exchange, that they
        present an area where various attacks could arise by sending
        data with identifiers already in use with malicious intent to
        confuse a receiver of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifiers conformant with this spec <em>MUST</em> be
        [[rfc3986]] conformant URIs. Unless otherwise noted, an
        identifier <em>MAY</em> be a DID identifier per [[did-core]], a
        UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]], or a [[URL]] that identifies a resource
        directly.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
          Presentations in this spec are
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>, which contain several notable identifiers
          that can be used for correlation, retrieval, and business rule
          processing of data.
        </p>
        These identifiers are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.id` — The unique ID of the
            presentation itself; think of this as identifying the wire
            transaction. This ID MUST be a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition` — The ID for the
            workflow definition, or the <em>type</em> of workflow that
            the presented credentials belong to. This ID MUST be a URN for a UUID
            v4 per [[rfc4122]], e.g., `urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6`.
          </li>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.workflow.instance` — The ID for the
            unique instance of the workflow, e.g., party A sending goods
            of a certain type (with particular data requirements to meet
            regulatory needs) to party B using workflow type X as
            defined by `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition`. This
            ID MUST be a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          `TraceablePresentation.id` <em>MUST</em> be unique to each
          presentation. A presentation received with a duplicate ID
          <em>MUST</em> be rejected with a 409 Conflict status code per
          [[rfc9110]]. A presenter encountering this error,
          <em>SHOULD</em> generate a new presentation, with a new UUID
          v4 for the ID and then retry the presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="502">
          The handling of duplicated `TraceablePresentation.id` requires discussion
          and consensus.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="485">
          There is active discussion regarding the addition of a member to a
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentation</a>
          with the name `replacesPresentation`. If this member is
          present, its value <em>SHOULD</em> be an ID of a prior
          presentation and <em>SHOULD</em> act as a signal to replace
          the prior presentation and any credentials contained within,
          and to prefer credentials in the new presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assemble a collection of Credentials linked together by a
          workflow, data may be queried by a combination of
          `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition` and
          `TraceablePresentation.workflow.instance`, assuming that the
          implementation's underlying data store persists presentation
          metadata upon receipt. Rules for ensuring the retrieval of the
          most "correct" credentials associated for that workflow
          instance are covered below in the section on Credentials.
        </p>

        <p class="issue" data-number="496">
          Some discussion and explicit clarification of use of `issuer`
          <em>SHOULD</em>
          be added to the spec text to clarify best practices for
          retrieval and ownership of data
        </p>
        <p>
          A `TraceablePresentation`, while being part of a two party
          exchange of information via a `VerifiablePresentation`,
          provides the ability for multiple parties to exchange related
          information by use of the same workflow definition and
          instance. Use of the same workflow definition and instance by
          multiple presenters implies that the credentials contained in
          the separate presentations are related, and
          <em>SHOULD</em> be treated as part of the same <em>instance</em> of a
          given workflow <em>type</em>. A good
          example of this type of scenario is when a vendor is exchanging some
          information, say a commercial invoice,
          with a third party, such as a broker, and the shipping company is
          presenting related information to that
          same broker.

          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>
          using this specification <em>MUST</em> contain the property
          `verifiableCredential.id`. This ID is unique to the object,
          entity, or action described in the credential. As per the
          [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] "The id property is intended to
          unambiguously refer to an object, such as a person, product,
          or organization. Using the id property allows for the
          expression of statements about specific things in the
          verifiable credential."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of credentials used in systems implementing this
          specification, a credential ID <em>MUST</em> be a UUID v4 per
          [[rfc4122]]. The issuing system <em>MUST</em> return the
          credential in question with an HTTP request to their API of
          `GET /credentials/{credential-id}`
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="497">
          This specification needs to specify precise usage of id for

    <h2>Interoperability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Participating platforms are proving actual interoperability by
      enrolling in continuous integration tests. These tests are based
      on Postman collections which orchestrate the interaction of
      participating parties, such as `Credential Issuance`, `Credential
      Verification`, and `Presentation Exchange`. These Postman
      collections are described with a set of
      <a
        href="https://w3id.org/traceability/interoperability/tree/main/docs/tutorials">tutorials</a>
      that show how to run the tests against a particular implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interoperability report is continuously created from the
      results of executing these collections, targeting the
      participating platforms. In cases of multi-party interactions
      (such as party A making a verifiable presentation to party B), all
      combinations of platform interchange are executed. The
      Interoperability report is executed by a GitHub Action on the
      Traceability Interoperability GitHub repository:

      In each test, the GitHub Action runner carries out a number of
      invocations, acting on behalf of varying parties taking different
      roles (`issuer`, `holder`, and `verifier`), in turn invoking the
      participating platform.
    </p>
    Below is an example of calls made by the runner as it is executing a
    DIDAuth Presentation Exchange flow:
    <ul>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/issue` on Party A's platform, representing
        Party A acting as `issuer`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/available` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/prove` on Party A's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>
        Runner calls `/presentations/submissions` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.
      </li>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/verify` on Party B's platform, representing
        Party B acting as `verifier`.</li>

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described by this
      specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications of
      this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged
      to seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
      implementing mission critical systems using the technology
      outlined in this specification.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described in this
      specification. As with any web standard or protocol
      implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes this
      information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is
      important to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such
      as [[WCAG21]], to ensure that all people, regardless of ability,
      can make use of this data. This is especially important when
      establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have
      historically created problems for assistive technologies.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations
      implementers should be aware of when publishing data described in
      this specification. As with any web standards or protocols
      implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it difficult
      for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
      languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of
      the specification and significantly diminish its value as a
      standard.

    <h2>Ethical and General Design Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The W3C Group Note on
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/"> Web Platform Design
        Principles </a>
      <em>SHOULD</em> be utilized as general guidance for contributions
      to this specification, as well as for developers implementing a
      solution that is in compliance with or that interacts with
      solutions implementing this specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, when implementing any solution on the web, the
      developer should have a strong concern that their solution is
      implemented in an ethical manner that showcases the appropriate
      and ethical use of technology. Any such solution should provide a
      net positive social benefit, and be cognizant of the variety of
      principles that must be balanced when building and deploying a
      solution. The W3C TAG document on
      <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web
        Principles</a>
      provides a strong enumeration of these principles and considerations for
      how to best implement a solution with
      those principles in mind.
