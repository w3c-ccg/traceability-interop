    </p>
    Version Definitions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
        version. Major versions MAY include
        breaking or non-backwards compatible changes
      </li>
      <li>MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
      over an authenticated channel. The purpose of the specification is to facilitate
      cross trust boundary interactions among organizations conducting or otherwise
      involved in trade, seeking to digitize and automate their operations.
      Examples of targeted organizations include Buyers, Sellers, Shippers, Consignees,
      Carriers, and Customs Authorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The specification comprises of the following necessary elements:
      <ul>
        <li>Discovery via an organization's <code>did:web</code></li>
        <li>Cross organization <code>OAuth2</code>-based authentication</li>
        <li>Structure of the <code>https</code>-based data exchange endpoint</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The specification is opinionated in order to promote actual interoperability.
      Baking more choices into the specification decreases ambiguity for
      implementers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification seeks to make implementation as simple and light a lift as possible,
      leveraging existing, well-known standards and technologies wherever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification attempts not to define any unnecessary functionality beyond the
      core use case of interoperability. Some obvious peripheral use cases include
      verifiable credential issuance and verification. Implementers are encouraged to design
      their platforms and applications to provide such functionality to best serve their
      specific circumstances.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Though this specification began as a fork of the
      <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/">VC-API specification</a>, it
      has diverged significantly. Knowledge and understanding of the
      <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/">VC-API specification</a> is
      not necessary for implementers of this specification.

    <h2>Rules for Processing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data exchanged according to this specification will often need to
      be handled by external systems that have a more transactional
      nature. By design, data exchanged using this specification is
      asynchronous in nature. This means that certain rules should be
      followed to ensure that a reciever of data using this
      specification can assemble a graph of connected data elements and
      have a high degree of certainty (unless they are missing data)
      that the data they are looking at is the most current information,
      assembled in the right order, and is the best known state at a
      given time. The following section details rules for handling
      identifiers and references to data to prevent issues with
      informational processing.
    </p>
    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        Identifiers in objects exchanged using this specification are
        particularly important, not least in that they uniquely identify
        an object or network transaction, but also, given the
        asynchronous nature of this mode of data exchange, that they
        present an area where various attacks could arise by sending
        data with identifiers already in use with malicious intent to
        confuse a receiver of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifiers conformant with this spec <em>MUST</em> be
        [[rfc3986]] conformant URIs. Unless otherwise noted, an
        identifier <em>MAY</em> be a DID identifier per [[did-core]], a
        UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]], or a [[URL]] that identifies a resource
        directly.
      </p>
      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
          Presentations in this spec are
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#traceable-presentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>, which contain several notable identifiers
          that can be used for correlation, retrieval, and business rule
          processing of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          `TraceablePresentation.id` <em>MUST</em> be unique to each
          presentation. A presentation received with a duplicate ID
          <em>MUST</em> be rejected with a 409 Conflict status code per
          [[rfc9110]]. A presenter encountering this error,
          <em>SHOULD</em> generate a new presentation, with a new UUID
          v4 for the ID and then retry the presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holder <em>MAY</em> indicate replacement of a previously sent
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#traceable-presentation">Traceable
            Presentation</a> with the `replace` property.
          If this member is present, its value <em>SHOULD</em> be interpreted as defined in
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#presentation-replace">Presentation Replace</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple Traceable Presentations <em>MAY</em> be correlated by referencing
          a <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#workflow">Workflow</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A `TraceablePresentation`, while being part of a two party
          exchange of information via a `VerifiablePresentation`,
          provides the ability for multiple parties to exchange related
          information by use of the same workflow definition and
          instance. Use of the same workflow definition and instance by
          multiple presenters implies that the credentials contained in
          the separate presentations are related, and
          <em>SHOULD</em> be treated as part of the same <em>instance</em> of a
          given workflow <em>type</em>. A good
          example of this type of scenario is when a vendor is exchanging some
          information, say a commercial invoice,
          with a third party, such as a broker, and the shipping company is
          presenting related information to that
          same broker.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Credentials</h2>
        <p>
          Verifiable Credentials bundled in
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>
          using this specification <em>MUST</em> contain the property
          `verifiableCredential.id`. This ID is unique to the object,
          entity, or action described in the credential. As per the
          [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] "The id property is intended to
          unambiguously refer to an object, such as a person, product,
          or organization. Using the id property allows for the
          expression of statements about specific things in the
          verifiable credential."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of credentials used in systems implementing this
          specification, a credential ID <em>MUST</em> be a UUID v4 per
          [[rfc4122]]. The issuing system <em>MUST</em> return the
          credential in question with an HTTP request to their API of
          `GET /credentials/{credential-id}`

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      Systems complying with this specification <em>SHOULD</em> leverage
      and comply with, and service providers complying with this
      specification <em>SHOULD</em> be able to provide results to, the
      guidance provided in
      <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final">

  <section class="normative">
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described by this
      specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications of
      this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged
      to seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
      implementing mission critical systems using the technology
      outlined in this specification.
    </p>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        As a rule, systems conforming with this specification <em>SHOULD</em>
        leverage and comply with encryption and security guidelines as
        listed in:
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/5/draft"
          rel="nofollow">FIPS 186-5 (DRAFT)</a>,
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/180/4/final"
          rel="nofollow">FIPS 180-4</a>, and
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/197/final"
          rel="nofollow">FIPS 197</a>. This
        effectively means that committers should be thinking along the lines of
        P256 versus other competing
        algorithms.
