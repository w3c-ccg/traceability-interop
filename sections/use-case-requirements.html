          >GS1 Digital Link</a
        >
        and <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis">GS1 EPCIS</a>, the
        need to discover identifiers associated with legal entities a products
        and associated web origins becomes critical to the adoption of
        verifiable credentials in a supply chain context.
