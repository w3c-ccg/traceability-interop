    This specification describes discovery and exchange mechanisms, particularly as they relate to supply chain use cases. The specification extends the core Verifiable Credential HTTP API definitions described in the VC-HTTP-API specification, adding cross-security domain interactions. Systems implementing the traceability-interop specification can exchange Verifiable Credentials over HTTP within proofed Verifiable Presentations. Exchanged Verifiable Credentials often implement schemas defined in the traceability-vocab specification, which is also targeted the supply chain industry.
