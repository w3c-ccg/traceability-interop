# Traceability Interop Postman Collection Setup

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the Traceability Interop Postman Collection, [`presentations-exchange-oauth.json`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/blob/main/docs/tutorials/presentations-exchange-oauth/presentations-exchange-oauth.json).

## Prerequisites

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) must be installed on your computer.

## Setting Up the Environment

1. Click on the "Settings" icon in the top right corner of the Postman window and select "Manage Environments".
2. Click on the "Add" button to create a new environment.
3. Give the environment a name, such as "Traceability Interop Environment".
4. Add the following variables to the environment, replacing the placeholders with your own values:
   - `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Traceability Interop API.
   - `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID obtained from your OAuth service provider.
   - `CLIENT_SCOPE`: The names of the scopes to request from your OAuth service provider. If your OAuth service provider requires that you name the specific scopes that should be included in the auth token, you should provide a value for this variable.
   - `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret obtained from your OAuth service provider. ðŸ”¥ Be especially careful with `CLIENT_SECRET`ðŸ”¥, If it is stolen it will allow an attacker the ability to perform all api operations supported by your service provider.
   - `TOKEN_AUDIENCE`: This value is used to identify the service provider API that the token will be used to access. You may need to configure your identity provider and token endpoint to support this value.
   - `TOKEN_ENDPOINT`:  This is the endpoint used to obtain an access token for Machine to Machine connection secured via <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code>.
5. Save the environment by clicking on the "Add" button.

## Running the Collection

1. Select the "Traceability Interop" collection in the Postman Workspace.
2. In the top right corner of the Postman window, select the environment you just created from the dropdown list.
3. Click on the "Runner" button in the top right corner of the window to open the Collection Runner.
4. In the Collection Runner, select the "Traceability Interop" collection and the environment you created earlier.
5. Click on the "Start Test" button to run the collection.
6. Observe the results of the API requests in the Collection Runner. The responses from the API will be displayed in the "Tests" tab for each request.
7. If a request fails, you can examine the response to see what went wrong.

By following these steps, you should now be able to successfully run the Traceability Interop Postman Collection and test the Traceability Interop API.
