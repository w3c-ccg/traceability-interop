# Traceability Interop Postman Collection Setup

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the Traceability Interop Postman Collection, [`traceable-presentation-workflow.postman_collection.json`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/blob/main/docs/tutorials/traceable-presentation-workflow/traceable-presentation-workflow.postman_collection.json).

## Prerequisites

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) must be installed on your computer.

## Setting Up the Collection

Open Postman and click on the "Import" button in the top left corner of the window.

In the Import dialog, select the "Link" tab, enter the url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/main/docs/tutorials/traceable-presentation-workflow/traceable-presentation-workflow.postman_collection.json`, and click `Continue`.

You will be asked to confirm the import.

After the collection has been imported, you should see a new collection in your Postman Workspace named "Workflow Tutorial".

## Setting Up the Environment

1. Click on the "Settings" icon in the top right corner of the Postman window and select "Manage Environments".
2. Click on the "Add" button to create a new environment.
3. Give the environment a name, such as "Traceability Interop Environment".
4. Add the following variables to the environment, replacing the placeholders with your own values. These should reflect the Machine to Machine OAuth Application configured on the Verifier's platform, used for the Holder to make the Traceable Presentation which includes Workflow details:
   - `API_BASE_URL`: Verifier platform's base URL. 
   - `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the M2M application, to be used by the Holder.
   - `CLIENT_SCOPE`: The names of the scopes to request from your OAuth service provider. If your OAuth service provider requires that you name the specific scopes that should be included in the auth token, you should provide a value for this variable.
   - `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret provided from the Verifier to the Holder. ðŸ”¥ Be especially careful with `CLIENT_SECRET`ðŸ”¥.
   - `TOKEN_ENDPOINT`:  This is the endpoint used to obtain an access token for M2M connection secured via <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code>.
   - `ORGANIZATION_DID_WEB`: Verifier's `did:web` used for service endpoint discovery, on which the presentation is made.
5. Save the environment by clicking on the "Add" button.

## Running the Collection

1. Select the "Workflow Tutorial" collection in the Postman Workspace.
2. In the top right corner of the Postman window, select the environment you just created from the dropdown list.
3. Click on the "Runner" button in the top right corner of the window to open the Collection Runner.
4. In the Collection Runner, select the "Workflow Tutorial" collection and the environment you created earlier.
5. Click on the "Start Test" button to run the collection.
6. Observe the results of the API requests in the Collection Runner. The responses from the API will be displayed in the "Tests" tab for each request.
7. If a request fails, you can examine the response to see what went wrong.

By following these steps, you should now be able to successfully run the Traceability Interop Postman Collection and test the Traceability Interop API.
