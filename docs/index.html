        This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
        Calendar Year target for major releases. Versioning tags will follow a
        pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`

        Version Definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
          version. Major versions MAY include breaking or non-backwards
          compatible changes
        </li>
        <li>
          MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
          functionality or extensions of objects that are backwards compatible
        </li>
        <li>
          PATCH - minor changes that are non breaking and resolve discovered
          issues or bugs
        </li>
      </ul>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided
      automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of
      instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the
      frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of
      incompatible versions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
        over an authenticated channel. Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP
        endpoints is defined, allowing authenticated data senders and receivers
        to exchange Verifiable Presentations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an
        interaction, notifying the receiver. The presentation receiver responds
        to the presentation intention with cryptographic material for completing
        the presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the
        Verifiable Presentation, which finally passed to the receiver.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
        operation and provides example inputs and expected responses.

        <img src="standards-stack.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
          The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the
          larger family of W3C CCG standards.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
            data in support of exchanged goods and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
            verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Process</em> defined standardized APIs for how to exchange
            Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and Verifiable Presentations
            (trace-interop).

          <li>
            <em>Semantics</em> are defined in a multitude of established
            vocabularies and come in many forms, from narrowly specialized,
            industry-vertical vocabularies, to broadly-applicable, generic
            vocabularies.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.
      </p>

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          As a rule, systems conforming with this specification SHOULD leverage
          and comply with encryption and security guidelines as listed in:
          <a

            rel="nofollow"

            rel="nofollow"
            >FIPS 197</a
          >. This effectively means that committers should be thinking along the
          lines of SHA-256, Ed25519, and Rijndael versus other competing
          algorithms.

        <h2>Selective Disclosure from Credentials</h2>
        <p class="issue">
          All current approaches to selective disclosure are active works in progress with
          notable security or other considerations.  These are actively being tracked in
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/39">Issue #39</a>. 
          Selective Disclosure using any mechanism SHOULD NOT be used for production data 
          at this time until further testing and security analysis has been performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selective disclosure of certain values from signed credentials is a highly desireable
          feature that is actively being worked towards.  At the moment, two general approaches 
          exist for this particular feature:
          <ul>
            <li>BBS+</li>
            <li>Merkle Tree Proofs</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <section class="normative">
          <h2>BBS+</h2>
          <p>
            BBS+ approaches to signatures for use with selective disclosure rely on pairing
            friendly curves, specifically BLS12-381 in the current specifications.

          <h2>Merkle Tree Proofs</h2>

            <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Merkle_proof">Merkle Tree</a> 
            based proofs for selective disclosure attempt to resolve
            concerns around requirements for pairing friendly curves leveraged in
            BBS+ and other approaches to selective disclosure by not mandating the
            hashing and signature suite mechanism so that those algorithms may be
            selected to meet the needs of a particular operating envrionment.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the current time, merkle proofs are unsuitable for production use, but have test implementations supporting both
            <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/Merkle-Disclosure-2021/">LD Signatures</a> 
            and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/Merkle-Disclosure-2021/jwp/">Json Web Proofs</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach should permit usage of Merkle Tree based methods for selective disclosure
            with NIST approved cryptography, and should also faciliate cryptographic agility
            with the introduction of 
            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">
              Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
            </a>.

          <p>
            Until there is more work done on both the specification, reference implementations, and
            evaluation of Merkle Tree Proofs they SHOULD NOT be used in production, but MAY be used
            for evalutation of selective disclosure capabilities.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standard or protocol implementation, ignoring accessibility
        issues makes this information unusable by a large subset of the
        population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines and
        standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

        This section details the general accessibility considerations to take
        into account when utilizing this data model.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section outlines general internationalization considerations to
        take into account when utilizing this data model.
