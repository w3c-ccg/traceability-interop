        This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
        Calendar Year target for major releases. Versioning tags will follow a
        pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
        <br >
        <br >
        Version Definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
          version. Major versions MAY include breaking or non-backwards
          compatible changes
        </li>
        <li>
          MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
          functionality or extensions of objects that are backwards compatible
        </li>
        <li>
          PATCH - minor changes that are non breaking and resolve discovered
          issues or bugs
        </li>
      </ul>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided
      automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of
      instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the
      frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of
      incompatible versions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
        over an authenticated channel. Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP
        endpoints is defined, allowing authenticated data senders and receivers
        to exchange Verifiable Presentations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an
        interaction, notifying the receiver. The presentation receiver responds
        to the presentation intention with cryptographic material for completing
        the presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the
        Verifiable Presentation, which finally passed to the receiver.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
        operation and provides example inputs and expected responses.

        <p>
          The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the
          larger family of W3C CCG standards.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
            data in support of exchanged goods and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
            verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Process</em> defined standardized APIs for how to exchange
            Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and Verifiable Presentations
            (trace-interop).
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Linked Data</em> establishes concise semantic context of the
            data exchanged, enabled with JSON-LD by the trace-vocab
            specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Semantics</em> are defined in a multitude of established
            vocabularies and come in many forms, from narrowly specialized,
            industry-vertical vocabularies, to broadly-applicable, generic
            vocabularies.

          <p>
            In the context of this API profile, we consider the specifics of workflows out of scope.
            We acknowledge that different use cases may have complicated workflows, which may yield 
            many individual presentations of credentials. 
          </p>

          <p>
            We enable the grouping of all presentations related to a definition, using the convention:

            We refer to Workflow Instance's as an execution of a particular workflow,

          <p>

            A distinct path for a distinct set of items being traced that either is declared

           <p>
            Properties may be attached to nodes via credentials and presentations that refer to the 
            same distinct CORRELATION ID.
           </p>
          
           <p>
            In a real world context, a PATH might be created to describe one party
            requesting a set of goods from some other location.  The PATH can then
            be used to group and associate the nodes as those goods move from the origination
            point (a node) to the end destination.  Any change in state, location, or 
            control (legal or physical responsibility of some kind for the goods) would be
            described as a node represented by a VP which has the PATH CORRELATION ID
            attached to it. 
           </p>

           <p>
             A path represents a strict subset of the information available to an observer 
             of all "Workflow Instance" related credentials. In other words,
             PATHs represent partial information related to a workflow instance.

        <h2>Selective Disclosure from Credentials</h2>
        <p class="issue">
          All current approaches to selective disclosure are active works in progress with
          notable security or other considerations.  These are actively being tracked in
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/39">Issue #39</a>. 
          Selective Disclosure using any mechanism SHOULD NOT be used for production data 
          at this time until further testing and security analysis has been performed.
          Selective Disclosure mechanisms MAY be used for testing and validation purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selective disclosure of certain values from signed credentials is a highly desireable
          feature that is actively being worked towards.  At the moment, two general approaches 
          exist for this particular feature:
          <ul>
            <li>BBS+</li>
            <li>Merkle Tree Proofs</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <section class="normative">
          <h2>BBS+</h2>
          <p>
            BBS+ approaches to signatures for use with selective disclosure rely on pairing
            friendly curves, specifically BLS12-381 in the current specifications.
          </p>

            <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures 2020</a> 
            MUST NOT be used due to issues related to one or more blank nodes as well
            as sensitivity around the ordering of a signed message.  See issue

          <p>
            <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Merkle_proof">Merkle Tree</a> 
            based proofs for selective disclosure attempt to resolve
            concerns around requirements for pairing friendly curves leveraged in
            BBS+ and other approaches to selective disclosure by not mandating the
            hashing and signature suite mechanism so that those algorithms may be
            selected to meet the needs of a particular operating envrionment.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the current time, Merkle proofs are unsuitable for production use, but test implementations support both
            <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/Merkle-Disclosure-2021/">LD Signatures</a> 
            and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/Merkle-Disclosure-2021/jwp/">Json Web Proofs</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach should permit usage of Merkle Tree based methods for selective disclosure
            with NIST approved cryptography, and should also faciliate cryptographic agility
            with the introduction of 
            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">

          <p>
            Until there is more work done on both the specification, reference implementations, and
            evaluation of Merkle Tree Proofs, they SHOULD NOT be used in production, but MAY be used
            for evalutation of selective disclosure capabilities.

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standard or protocol implementation, ignoring accessibility
        issues makes this information unusable by a large subset of the

        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and

          Web Platform Design Principles
        </a> should be utilized as general guidance for contributions to this specification,

        or that interacts with solutions implementing this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, when implementing any solution on the web, the developer should
        have a strong concern that their solution is implemented in an ethical manner
        that showcases the appropriate and ethical use of technology.  Any such solution 
        should provide a net positive social benefit, and be cognizant of the variety
        of principles that must be balanced when building and deploying a solution.
        The W3C TAG document on 
        <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web Principles</a>
