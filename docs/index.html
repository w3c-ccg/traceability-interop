        This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
        Calendar Year target for major releases. Versioning tags will follow a
        pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
        <br /><br />
        Version Definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
          version. Major versions MAY include breaking or non-backwards
          compatible changes
        </li>
        <li>
          MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
          functionality or extensions of objects that are backwards compatible
        </li>
        <li>
          PATCH - minor changes that are non breaking and resolve discovered
          issues or bugs
        </li>
      </ul>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided
      automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of
      instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the
      frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of
      incompatible versions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
        over an authenticated channel. Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP
        endpoints is defined, allowing authenticated data senders and receivers
        to exchange Verifiable Presentations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an interaction,
        notifying the receiver. The presentation receiver responds to the
        presentation intention with cryptographic material for completing the
        presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the Verifiable
        Presentation, which finally passed to the receiver. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
        operation and provides example inputs and expected responses.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <dl class="termlist">
        <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

        <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
          communication between the various roles in this specification.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.
      </p>

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          As a rule, systems conforming with this sepcification should leverage
          and comply with encryption and security guidelines as listed in:
          <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/5/draft" rel="nofollow">FIPS 186-5 (DRAFT)</a>, 
          <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/180/4/final" rel="nofollow">FIPS 180-4</a>, and to 
          <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/197/final" rel="nofollow">FIPS 197</a>.  
          This effectively means that commiters should be thinking along the lines of SHA-256, Ed25519, and Rijndael vs other competing algorithms.  
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Encryption in Transport</h2>
        <p>
          Any system conforming with this specification for interoperability
          MUST utilze TLS and comply with <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r2.pdf">
            NIST SP 800-52 rev2
          </a> or superceding publications for configuration and use of TLS in
          transport of data over API or web endpoints. 
        </p>  
        <p>
          Special care should be given to avoid use of obsolete TLS profiles
          or configurations that do not match the latest TLS Protocol configurations.
          The <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jan/05/2002560140/-1/-1/0/ELIMINATING_OBSOLETE_TLS_UOO197443-20.PDF">special publication</a> 
          provided by the NSA on this topic should be referred to as a guide
          for systems adminstrators deploying infrastructure indented to 
          comply with the standard for interoperability discussed here.
          <br/>
          Tools lists such as those compiled <a href="https://github.com/nsacyber/Mitigating-Obsolete-TLS">here</a>
          may be helpful in identifying and mitigating issues related to TLS 
          misconfiguration.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

        into account when utilizing this data model.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section outlines general internationalization considerations to
        take into account when utilizing this data model.
