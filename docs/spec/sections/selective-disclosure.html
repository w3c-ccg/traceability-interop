  <h3>Selective Disclosure</h3>
  <p class="note">
    The group is currently considering 
    how to leverage the following drafts 
    which are aimed at providing selective disclosure capabilities.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      [[VC-DI-BBS]]
    </li>
    <li>
      [[VC-SD-JWT]]
    </li>
  </ul>
    <p>
      Selective disclosure of certain values from signed credentials is a
      highly desireable feature that is actively being worked towards.
    </p>
    At the moment, two general approaches exist for this particular feature:
    <ul>
      <li>

          href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures/">draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-07</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
