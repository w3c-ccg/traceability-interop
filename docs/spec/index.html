      This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
      Calendar Year target for major releases.
      Versioning tags will follow a pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
    </p>
    Version Definitions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous
        major version. Major versions MAY include breaking or
        non-backwards compatible changes
      </li>
      <li>
        MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
        functionality or extensions of objects
      </li>
      <li>PATCH - minor changes that are backwards compatible and
        resolve discovered issues or bugs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec
      This approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with
      and provide automated testing and validation against defined types
      without worry of instability or breaking changes being introduced,
      while also limiting the frequency of possibly breaking changes to
      prevent a large number of incompatible versions.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
      over an authenticated channel.
      Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP endpoints is defined, allowing
      authenticated data senders and receivers to
      exchange Verifiable Presentations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an interaction,
      notifying the receiver. The
      presentation receiver responds to the presentation intention with
      cryptographic material for completing the
      presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the Verifiable
      Presentation, which finally passed to the
      receiver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
      operation and provides example inputs and
      expected responses.

      <p>The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the
        larger family of W3C CCG standards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
          data in support of exchanged goods and
          services.
        </li>
        <li>The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
          verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.</li>
        <li>
          The <em>Process</em> layer defines standardized APIs for how to exchange
          Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and
          Verifiable Presentations (trace-interop).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Linked Data</em> establishes concise semantic context of the data
          exchanged, enabled with JSON-LD by the
          trace-vocab specification.

        <li>
          <em>Semantics</em> are defined in a multitude of established
          vocabularies and come in many forms, from
          narrowly specialized, industry-vertical vocabularies, to
          broadly-applicable, generic vocabularies.

    <h3>Workflows</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Workflows</em> are a critical concept in this specification that
      enable presenters to correlate individual
      presentations. A workflow <em>definition</em> can be used to indicate that
      presentations relate to the same type
      of workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Workflow <em>instances</em> indicate that separate individual
      presentations are part of the very same workflow.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Workflows for US Customs and Border Protection (US CBP)</h3>
      <img src="resources/workflow-def-ex.png" alt="workflow-def-ex"
        width="75%" />
      <p>
        In the above example, two separate 7501 Entry Summaries are
        submitted to US CBP at different points in time, and related to
        different imports. By specifying the same workflow
        <em>definition</em>, it is made clear to US
        CBP that both relate to the same type of import workflows.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/workflow-inst-ex.png" alt="workflow-inst-ex"
        width="75%" />
      <p>
        The majority of data elements in a "10+2" Importer Security
        Filing must be presented to CBP no later than 24 hours before
        vessel loading, and the remaining data elements no later than 24
        hours before arrival. Specifying the same workflow
        <em>instance</em> indicates to US CBP that the two presentations
        are part of the same import workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        A workflow definition indended for use with US CBP imports MUST
        have a corresponding plain text <em>manifest document</em> that
        may be uniquely identified, referenced, and retrieved by a third
        party in a publicly accessible and documented manner by the UUID
        of the workflow definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This workflow manifest document MUST list each required credential from
        the
        <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/#terminology">
          Traceability Vocabulary </a>, one per
        line, and identified by the "type" of credential, for the workflow to be
        considered "complete". Completeness
        in this sense refers to an optimal state where all possible information
        that can be provided in relation to
        that workflow definition is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the credential "type" a space, followed by a numeric value
        that ranges from 0 to 1 MAY be added. If
        this value is not provided a value of 1 MUST by inferred by any system
        using this property. This numeric value
        MUST be referred to as "weight", and may be utilized to calculate a
        weighted average indicating the
        completeness of a particular workflow instance.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: add example, and point to weighted avg calc -->
      <p class="issue">
        The standard calculation for weighted averages and algorithm for
        calculating this weighted average indicating
        the completeness of available information should be described, along
        with examples.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        Stakeholders at US CBP should be consulted to determine if this weighted
        average SHOULD, MUST, or MAY be
        included with each traceable presentation.

    <h2>Rules for Processing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data exchanged according to this specification will often need to be
      handled by external systems that have a more transactional nature. By
      design, data exchanged using this specification is asynchronous in nature.
      This means that certain rules should be followed to ensure that a reciever
      of data using this specification can assemble a graph of connected data
      elements and have a high degree of certainty (unless they are missing
      data) that the data they are looking at is the most current information,
      assembled in the right order, and is the best known state at a given time.
      The following section details rules for handling identifiers and
      references to data to prevent issues with informational processing.
    </p>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        Identifiers in objects exchanged using this specification are
        particularly important, not least of which in that they uniquely
        identify an object or network transaction, but also, given the
        asynchronous nature of this mode of data exchange, that they
        present an area where various attacks could arise by sending of
        data with identifiers already in use with malicious intent to
        confuse a receiver of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifiers conformant with this spec must be a [[rfc3986]] and
        unless otherwise noted MAY be either a DID identifier per
        [[did-core]] or a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]], or a [[URL]] that
        identifies the resource directly.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
          Presentations in this spec are
          <a
            href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>
          which contain a few notable identifiers that can be used for
          correlations, retrievals, and business rule for processing of
          data.
        </p>
        These identifiers are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.id` the unique ID of the presentation
            itself, think of this as identifying the wire transaction.
            This ID MUST be a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition` the ID for the
            workflow definition, or type of workflow that the presented
            credentials belong to. This ID MUST be a UUID v4 per
            [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
          <li>
            `TraceablePresentation.workflow.instance` the ID for the
            unique instance of the workflow - e.g. party A sending goods
            of a certain type (with particular data requirements to meet
            regulatory needs) to party B using workflow type X as defined
            by `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition`. This ID MUST
            be a UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a rule, `TraceablePresentation.id` MUST be unique to each
          presentation. A presentation received with a duplicate ID MUST
          be rejected with a 409 Conflict status code per [[rfc9110]]. A
          presenter encountering this error, should generate a new
          presentation, with a new UUID v4 for the ID and then retry the
          presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          There is active discussion in
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/485">Issue
            485</a> regarding the addition of
          a member to
          <a
            href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>
          with the name `replacesPresentation` - if this member is
          present, its value should be an ID of a prior presentation and
          should act as a signal to replace the prior presentation and
          any credentials contained within, and to prefer credentials in
          the new presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assemble a collection of Credentials linked together by a
          workflow, data may be queried by a combination of
          `TraceablePresentation.workflow.definition` and
          `TraceablePresentation.workflow.instance`, assuming that the
          implementation's underlying data store persists presentation
          metadata upon receiving that data. Rules for ensuring the
          retrieval of the most "correct" credentials associated for
          that workflow instance are covered below in the section on
          Credentials.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
          Some discussion and explicit clarification of use of `issuer`
          should be added to the spec text to clarify best practices for
          retrieval and ownership of data
        </p>
        <p>
          `TraceablePresentation`s while being part of a two party
          exchange of information via a `VerifiablePresentation`,
          provide the ability for multiple parties to exchange related
          information by use of the same workflow definition and
          instance. Use of the same workflow definition and instance by
          multiple presenters implies that the credentials contained in
          the seperate presentations are related, and should be treated
          as part of the same unique workflow. A good example of this
          type of scenario is where a vendor is exchanging some
          information with a third party such as a broker, say a
          commercial invoice, and the shipping company is presenting
          related information to that same broker.

          using this specification MUST contain the property
          `verifiableCredential.id`. This ID is unique to the object,
          entity, or action described in the credential. As per the
          [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] "The id property is intended to
          unambiguously refer to an object, such as a person, product,
          or organization. Using the id property allows for the
          expression of statements about specific things in the
          verifiable credential."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of credentials used in systems implementing this
          specification a credential ID MUST be a UUID v4 per
          [[rfc4122]]. The issuing system MUST return the credential in
          question with an HTTP request to their API of `GET
          /credentials/{credential-id}`
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          This specification needs to specify precise usage of id for

    <h2>Interoperability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Participating platforms are proving actual interoperability by
      enrolling in continuous integration tests. These tests are based
      on Postman collections which orchestrate the interaction of
      participating parties; for example, `Credential Issuance`,
      `Credential Verification`, and `Presentation Exchange`. These
      Postman collections are described with a set of
      <a
        href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/tree/main/docs/tutorials">tutorials</a>
      that show how to run the tests against a particular implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interoperability report is continuously created from the
      results of executing these collections, targeting the
      participating platforms. In cases of multi-party interactions
      (such as party A making a verifiable presentation to party B), all
      combinations of platform interchange are executed. The
      Interoperability report is executed by a GitHub Action on the
      Traceability Interoperability GitHub repository:
      <a
        href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/actions/workflows/interoperability-report.yml">interoperability-report.yml</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In each test, the GitHub Action runner carries out a number of
      invocations, acting on behalf of varying parties taking different
      roles (`issuer`, `holder` and `verifier`), in turn invoking the
      participating platform.
    </p>
    Below is an example of calls made by the runner as it is executing a DIDAuth
    Presentation Exchange flow:
    <ul>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/issue` on Party A's platform, representing
        Party A acting as `issuer`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/available` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/prove` on Party A's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>
        Runner calls `/presentations/submissions` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.
      </li>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/verify` on Party B's platform, representing
        Party B acting as `verifier`.</li>

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described by this
      specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications of
      this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged
      to seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
      implementing mission critical systems using the technology
      outlined in this specification.

        mechanisms MAY be used for testing and validation purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Selective disclosure of certain values from signed credentials
        is a highly desireable feature that is actively being worked

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described in this
      specification. As with any web standard or protocol
      implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes this
      information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is
      important to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such
      as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of ability, can
      make use of this data. This is especially important when
      establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have
      historically created problems for assistive technologies.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations
      implementers should be aware of when publishing data described in

      implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it difficult
      for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
      languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of
      the specification and significantly diminish its value as a
      standard.

    <h2>Ethical and General Design Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The W3C Group Note on

      contributions to this specification, as well as for developers
      implementing a solution that is in compliance with or that
      interacts with solutions implementing this specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, when implementing any solution on the web, the
      developer should have a strong concern that their solution is
      implemented in an ethical manner that showcases the appropriate
      and ethical use of technology. Any such solution should provide a
      net positive social benefit, and be cognizant of the variety of
      principles that must be balanced when building and deploying a
      solution. The W3C TAG document on
      <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web
        Principles</a>
      provides a strong enumeration of these principles and
      considerations for how to best implement a solution with those
      principles in mind.
