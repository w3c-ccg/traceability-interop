      This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
      Calendar Year target for major releases.
      Versioning tags will follow a pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`
    </p>
    Version Definitions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major
        version. Major versions MAY include
        breaking or non-backwards compatible changes
      </li>
      <li>MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
        functionality or extensions of objects</li>
      <li>PATCH - minor changes that are backwards compatible and resolve
        discovered issues or bugs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to
      integrate with and provide automated testing and validation against
      defined types without worry of instability
      or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the frequency of
      possibly breaking changes to prevent
      a large number of incompatible versions.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
      over an authenticated channel.
      Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP endpoints is defined, allowing
      authenticated data senders and receivers to
      exchange Verifiable Presentations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
      operation and provides example inputs and
      expected responses.

      <p>The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the
        larger family of W3C CCG standards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
          data in support of exchanged goods and
          services.
        </li>
        <li>The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
          verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.</li>
        <li>
          The <em>Process</em> layer defines standardized APIs for exchanging
          Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and
          Verifiable Presentations (trace-interop).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Linked Data</em> establishes a concise semantic context of the
          data exchanged, enabled with JSON-LD by
          the <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability">Traceability
            Vocabulary</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Semantics</em> are defined in a multitude of established
          vocabularies and come in many forms, from
          narrowly-specialized, industry-vertical vocabularies, to
          broadly-applicable, generic vocabularies.

    <h2>Rules for Processing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data exchanged according to this specification will often need to
      be handled by external systems that have a more transactional
      nature. By design, data exchanged using this specification is
      asynchronous in nature. This means that certain rules should be
      followed to ensure that a reciever of data using this
      specification can assemble a graph of connected data elements and
      have a high degree of certainty (unless they are missing data)
      that the data they are looking at is the most current information,
      assembled in the right order, and is the best known state at a
      given time. The following section details rules for handling
      identifiers and references to data to prevent issues with
      informational processing.
    </p>
    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        Identifiers in objects exchanged using this specification are
        particularly important, not least in that they uniquely identify
        an object or network transaction, but also, given the
        asynchronous nature of this mode of data exchange, that they
        present an area where various attacks could arise by sending
        data with identifiers already in use with malicious intent to
        confuse a receiver of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifiers conformant with this spec <em>MUST</em> be
        [[rfc3986]] conformant URIs. Unless otherwise noted, an
        identifier <em>MAY</em> be a DID identifier per [[did-core]], a
        UUID v4 per [[rfc4122]], or a [[URL]] that identifies a resource
        directly.
      </p>
      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
          Presentations in this spec are
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#traceable-presentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>, which contain several notable identifiers
          that can be used for correlation, retrieval, and business rule
          processing of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          `TraceablePresentation.id` <em>MUST</em> be unique to each
          presentation. A presentation received with a duplicate ID
          <em>MUST</em> be rejected with a 409 Conflict status code per
          [[rfc9110]]. A presenter encountering this error,
          <em>SHOULD</em> generate a new presentation, with a new UUID
          v4 for the ID and then retry the presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The holder <em>MAY</em> indicate replacement of a previously sent
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#traceable-presentation">Traceable
            Presentation</a> with the `replace` property.
          If this member is present, its value <em>SHOULD</em> be interpreted as defined in
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#presentation-replace">Presentation Replace</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple Traceable Presentations <em>MAY</em> be correlated by referencing
          a <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#workflow">Workflow</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="issue" data-number="496">
          Some discussion and explicit clarification of use of `issuer`
          <em>SHOULD</em>
          be added to the spec text to clarify best practices for
          retrieval and ownership of data
        </p>
        <p>
          A `TraceablePresentation`, while being part of a two party
          exchange of information via a `VerifiablePresentation`,
          provides the ability for multiple parties to exchange related
          information by use of the same workflow definition and
          instance. Use of the same workflow definition and instance by
          multiple presenters implies that the credentials contained in
          the separate presentations are related, and
          <em>SHOULD</em> be treated as part of the same <em>instance</em> of a
          given workflow <em>type</em>. A good
          example of this type of scenario is when a vendor is exchanging some
          information, say a commercial invoice,
          with a third party, such as a broker, and the shipping company is
          presenting related information to that
          same broker.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="normative">
        <h2>Credentials</h2>
        <p>
          Verifiable Credentials bundled in
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#TraceablePresentation">Traceable
            Presentations</a>
          using this specification <em>MUST</em> contain the property
          `verifiableCredential.id`. This ID is unique to the object,
          entity, or action described in the credential. As per the
          [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] "The id property is intended to
          unambiguously refer to an object, such as a person, product,
          or organization. Using the id property allows for the
          expression of statements about specific things in the
          verifiable credential."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of credentials used in systems implementing this
          specification, a credential ID <em>MUST</em> be a UUID v4 per
          [[rfc4122]]. The issuing system <em>MUST</em> return the
          credential in question with an HTTP request to their API of
          `GET /credentials/{credential-id}`
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="497">
          This specification needs to specify precise usage of id for
          members of credentials as well, in the furtherance or reuse of
          data already defined elsewhere with a defined id, e.g., an
          address, or other commonly repeated object

    <h2>Interoperability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Participating platforms are proving actual interoperability by
      enrolling in continuous integration tests. These tests are based
      on Postman collections which orchestrate the interaction of
      participating parties, such as `Credential Issuance`, `Credential
      Verification`, and `Presentation Exchange`.
      Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/tree/main/docs/tutorials">interoperability</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/tree/main/tests">conformance</a>
      documentation for details on how to import and run these Postman test suites.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interoperability report is continuously created from the
      results of executing these collections, targeting the
      participating platforms. In cases of multi-party interactions
      (such as party A making a verifiable presentation to party B), all
      combinations of platform interchange are executed. The
      Interoperability report is executed by a GitHub Action on the
      Traceability Interoperability GitHub repository:
      <a
        href="https://w3id.org/traceability/interoperability/actions/workflows/interoperability-report.yml">interoperability-report.yml</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In each test, the GitHub Action runner carries out a number of
      invocations, acting on behalf of varying parties taking different
      roles (`issuer`, `holder`, and `verifier`), in turn invoking the
      participating platform.
    </p>
    Below is an example of calls made by the runner as it is executing a
    DIDAuth Presentation Exchange flow:
    <ul>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/issue` on Party A's platform, representing
        Party A acting as `issuer`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/available` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>Runner calls `/presentations/prove` on Party A's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.</li>
      <li>
        Runner calls `/presentations/submissions` on Party B's platform,
        representing Party A acting as `holder`.
      </li>
      <li>Runner calls `/credentials/verify` on Party B's platform, representing
        Party B acting as `verifier`.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OAS Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The Traceability Interoperability
      <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/interoperability/openapi">Open API
        Specification</a>
      is designed to be easily implemented and used to access conforming
      platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make use of the provide OpenAPI specifications
      directly, several placeholder URLs need to be modified to reflect
      your operating environment:
    </p>
    <p>Add the target <code>server</code>:</p>
    <p></p>
    <pre class="example">
          servers:
            - url: https://conformant-platform.example.com
    </pre>
    <p>Add the target <code>tokenUrl</code>:</p>
    <pre class="example">
        components:
          securitySchemes:
            OAuth2:
              type: oauth2
              flows:

                  tokenUrl: https://conformant-platform.example.com/oauth/token
    </pre>
    <h3>Code Generation</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href=""><code>openapi-typescript-codegen</code></a> project provides
      a means for generating typescript clients based on OpenAPI specifications.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described by this
      specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications of
      this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged
      to seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
      implementing mission critical systems using the technology
      outlined in this specification.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers
      should be aware of when processing data described in this
      specification. As with any web standard or protocol
      implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes this
      information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is
      important to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such
      as [[WCAG21]], to ensure that all people, regardless of ability,
      can make use of this data. This is especially important when
      establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have
      historically created problems for assistive technologies.

      account when utilizing this data

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations
      implementers should be aware of when publishing data described in
      this specification. As with any web standards or protocols
      implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it difficult
      for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
      languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of
      the specification and significantly diminish its value as a
      standard.

      to take into account when utilizing this data model.

    <h2>Ethical and General Design Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The W3C Group Note on
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/"> Web Platform Design
        Principles </a>
      serves well as general guidance for contributions
      to this specification, as well as for developers implementing a
      solution that is in compliance with or that interacts with
      solutions implementing this specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, when implementing any solution on the web, the
      developer should have a strong concern that their solution is
      implemented in an ethical manner that showcases the appropriate
      and ethical use of technology. Any such solution should provide a
      net positive social benefit, and be cognizant of the variety of
      principles that must be balanced when building and deploying a
      solution. The W3C TAG document on
      <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/">Ethical Web
        Principles</a>
      provides a strong enumeration of these principles and considerations for
      how to best implement a solution with
      those principles in mind.
